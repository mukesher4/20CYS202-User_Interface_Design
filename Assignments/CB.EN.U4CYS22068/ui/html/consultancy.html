  <summary style="font-size:23px;color:#082454;">Does TeleMed pick up on the first ring?  </summary>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">With a continuous presence of over 100 operators on-site throughout the day, we strive to answer your call promptly, often on the first ring. While there may be occasional spikes in call volume, preventing us from answering every call immediately, our color-coded system provides real-time insights into incoming call types and their hold durations. If a call exceeds a specified number of rings, a designated box on our operators' screens turns black, signaling the need for an immediate response.</p>

  <summary style="font-size:23px;color:#082454;">Does TeleMed pick up on the first ring?  </summary>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">With over 100+ operators on-site at all times, your call will be answered on the first ring the majority of the day. There are occasional circumstances in which the call volume that TeleMed is receiving spikes up and the operators will not be able to answer every call on the first ring. However, our color-coded system allows us to see exactly what type of call is coming in and for how long the call has been holding. If a call reaches a certain number of rings a box will change to black on our operatorâ€™s screen indicating that the call needs to be answered immediately.</p>

  <summary style="font-size:23px;color:#082454;">Do I need to sign a contract?</summary>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">TeleMed does require a contract for our services. However, we are lenient with those businesses who are tentative in the beginning, oftentimes allowing for month-by-month plans for the first couple of months to make sure that the customer is happy with and understands the service. Typically though, TeleMed requires either a 1 or 2 year contract for both new and existing customers. The contract is very easy to understand and is simply there as a means of documenting, for us and you as the customer, the exact specifications of what is required on each of our parts. The contract will guarantee that both parties know exactly what the other wants.</p>
